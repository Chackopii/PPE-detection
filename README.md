# PPE-detection

A basic streamlit application for detecting different PPE equipment 

    1. where we take two types of files Image and Video 

    2. which is then passed over to the pre-trained yolov8 model 

    3. Image and Video are passed differently

    4. The output for the image is the detection of different PPE equipment

    5. The output for video is where the video is streamed and the PPE equipment is tracked live
